      <h1>Visualizing BoardGameGeek’s Top 100 Boardgames</h1>
      <p><a href='https://boardgamegeek.com/'>BoardGameGeek</a> is a popular site that curates statistics and reviews of board games. This data includes a ranking for each board game with rank being the highest-rated game. The <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/mrpantherson/board-game-data'>Board Game Data</a> dataset by <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/mrpantherson'>mrpantherson</a> features a table of statistics on the board games that were listed in BoardGameGeek’s records in March 2017. Below are graphs comparing the top 100 ranked board games based on mrpantherson’s dataset, with a focus on game categories, mechanics, the number of players, and playtime.</p>
      <p>The top 100 shows a great diversity of categories and mechanics. The games tend to go from 15-30 minutes of playtime to 4-5 hours. “The 7th Continent” stands out on both ends, as its playtime can range from 5 minutes to over 16 hours. The most common range for the number of players is 2-4. However, a large number can be played with only one player, and “The Resistance: Avalon” can go up to 10 players.</p>
